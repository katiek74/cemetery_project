In this dataset we got to explore burial records from the historic Nashville City Cemetery Association. This dataset was particularly “messy” as entries were transcribed exactly to match the entries in the interment books including numerous misspellings and diseases referred to by many different names. While time did not allow for perfection, much data cleaning occurred. Once the data was cleaned, we were given a set of data questions to answer using pivot tables in Excel such as finding the most common causes of death, burials per year and month, and age at the time of burial.  We were then given the task to create a visualization to increase interest in the cemetery. This led me to explore the high rate of infant deaths and research infant mortality rates to bring in some outside data.

<b>The assignment:</b><br>
The city of Nashville provides a dataset of known burials in city cemeteries from 1846 through 1979. This dataset holds factual information, but it also offers a fascinating glimpse into historical trends in medicine, literacy, racial equality, and more.

The Nashville City Cemetery Association has asked you to explore the dataset to create charts that can be used in marketing materials. The exercises are a _starting point_ for exploring the data and creating visualizations. Once you have completed the exercises, create additional visualizations to accompany storytelling points.
